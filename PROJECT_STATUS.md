1. Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8001/admin/
2. Login with: `admin` / `admin123`
3. Explore all the models and data

### 3. Try the Browsable API

1. Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/auth/login/
2. Try logging in with any sample user
3. Navigate to different endpoints

### 4. Key API Endpoints to Test

#### Authentication

```

#### Projects & Events

```bash
GET  /api/projects/
POST /api/projects/create/
GET  /api/events/upcoming/
```

## 🔧 Development Commands

```bash
# Create migrations after model changes
python manage.py makemigrations

# Apply migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Load sample data
python manage.py create_sample_data
python manage.py create_sample_subjects

# Run tests
